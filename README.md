# DOM Events Assignment

This project implements a small web application that demonstrates interaction with the DOM using JavaScript event handling. The application includes features such as a timer, a counter with increment and decrement buttons, a "like" button, a comment section, and pause/resume functionality for the timer.

## Features

- **Timer Incrementation**: Displays a timer that increments every second.
- **Counter Increment and Decrement**: Allows manual incrementing and decrementing of a counter using buttons.
- **"Like" Button**: Adds likes for the current counter value and displays the count.
- **Pause and Resume**: Pauses and resumes the timer, disabling/enabling buttons accordingly.
- **Comments**: Allows users to leave comments which are displayed in a list.
